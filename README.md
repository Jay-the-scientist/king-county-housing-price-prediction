# King County Housing Price Prediction
This project analyzes housing data from King County to build models for predicting home sale prices. The goal is to aid in real estate investment decisions. 

## Objective
As a data analyst at a real estate investment trust, I was tasked with determining factors that influence housing prices and developing predictive models. This will help assess markets and value of potential properties to purchase.

## Installation
Install the required Python libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## The Data
The dataset contains over 21,000 home sale records for King County, WA between 2014-2015. Features include property details like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, building age, as well as location and sale date/price.

## Methodology
Data preprocessing involved removing outliers, converting date values, and engineering new features like age of the home. Exploratory analysis identified strong correlations, especially between square footage and price. Models such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor were trained and evaluated. Metrics like RÂ² and RMSE were used to assess performance.

## Results
- Living space (sqft_living) had the strongest correlation with price.
- Newer houses and properties in premium locations commanded higher prices.
